# Laptop Customizer

This application is completely functional in that it does exactly what it is supposed to do. 
On closer examination of the source code, you notice that all the functionality have been built 
into a single component! There is no hierarchy of components. The single component has grown 
quite large and is doing too many different things. Unfortunately, apart from the source code, 
the former developer did not provide any documentation.

Your task is to refactor this application using a more React style approach to the problem. 
Note the following, however:

the style is not very important, that is, try to keep the same style, but if you break it do 
not spend too much time on it and do not spend any time trying to improve the style.

All the functionality works so code to perform the various tasks have been written and you can 
just reuse that code. No need to write new code. If the app does not do something that you think 
it should then chances are the decision to leave it out was deliberate.

Start by breaking down the user interface into components and drawing a hierarchical tree of 
components. You should be able to break it down into at least five components, possibly even 
more! Once you are satisfied that you have sufficiently broken it down then decide on state 
and where it should live. Finally, add the interactivity.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
